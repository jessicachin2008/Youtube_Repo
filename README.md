In our project, we will investigate the possible relationships between sleep and GPA, and sleep and mental health. We will understand and analyze data we find online and create visualizations of this data to help us understand what the relationships mean. Learning about possible consequences due to the lack of sleep can help us make steps towards a healthier life-style by increasing (or decreasing) the amount of sleep we get.
