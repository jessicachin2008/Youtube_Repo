# Does Sleep Affect Academic Success

## Introduction
1. **Problem situation:** The direct stakeholders would include everybody while indirect stakeholders are the people you interact with on a day-to-day basis. Values are health, relationships, performance, driving, memory, mental health, and cognition. However, tensions might revolve around how much social time one can have, time for homework, time for entertainment, or even time for self-care. When it comes to sleep-time, there’s not much evidence for policy or ethical elements.
2. **What is the problem:** In general, people don’t get enough sleep everyday. How does sleep deprivation impact people’s life? Studies show that each and every person’s sleep habits can be generalized. It is recommended for college students to have between 7 to 9 hours of sleep. There are many downsides to not getting enough sleep, like making you forgetful, causing weight gain, messing with our mood, and impacting our basic health. Understanding the problems of sleep can help us better our sleep schedules and in turn better our quality of life.
3. **Why does the problem matter:** Because college students don’t get enough sleep every night, academic performance is decreased, mental health becomes worse, and many other drawbacks are prevalent. Also having a lack of sleep usually correlates with decreased physical performance. All of these factors they affect each individual person. Lack of sleep also increases the chances for being involved in an accident. However, we are going to focus on academic performance. Also having too much sleep can be detrimental for health. Learning about possible consequences due to the lack of sleep can help us make steps towards a healthier life-style by increasing (or decreasing) the amount of sleep we get.
4. **How will you address the problem:** Since the problem involves the person making the decision to alter his sleeping pattern, we can’t force anyone to change their sleeping habits. However, we can give a good advice for the benefits of having the right amount of sleep. Each person is different, so the amount of sleep that a person needs can vary. We will consider other factors as well including individual scheduling, classes and more.

## Research Questions
1. **One research question might be:** What is the relationship between the amount of sleep and average GPA for each student? This question will try to evaluate and understand an individual’s academic performance relative to the amount of sleep they get, something we can apply to our lives as college students - maybe finding a good amount of time to sleep that would most benefit us for school.
2. **Another research question might be:** What is the relationship between the amount of sleep one gets and one’s mental health? We understand that there is a lot of talk about how depression affects the way someone sleeps, so we want to investigate what the correlation is, especially at UW.

## Data sets
1. **“Gender, Age, Year in College, Hours of Sleep, and GPA”** The dataset was found on StatCrunch created by user kayley_boucher, last edited in April 23rd, 2017. Although it does not meet the requirements of 200 participants and six observations, we thought it would be important to understand what those patterns showed. It opened the door for us to investigate, more specifically, the relationship between hours of sleep and GPA while considering the other variables of gender, age, and participants year in college. This dataset surveyed 80 participants with five attributes.

2. **“Sleep Study”** This dataset was also found on StatCrunch and created by user shlee, last edited on November 14th, 2016. In their description of the dataset, the user is an instructor at Viterbo University who surveyed a sample of students who completed a skills test to measure cognitive function, answered questions about attitudes and habits, and kept a sleep diary to record time and quality of sleep over a two week period. This dataset surveyed 253 participants and includes 27 attributes.

3. **"Washington College Students Study"** In addition, we want to survey students at the UW through a Google Form’s Survey to find at least 150+ submissions from anonymous participants. We hope to learn about the relationship between certain mental health attributes and GPA with the amount of sleep we get. This will be a volunteer survey.

4. Finally, we hope to include more datasets (found in our references) within our projects if we find them necessary and helpful.

## Information Visualization
1. For one of the visualizations, we would like to create a **scatter plot**. For the x-axis, we will provide information regarding the hours of sleep, and on the y-axis, we will show the GPA that correlates to the hours of sleep. When you hover over the points on the scatterplot, it would be able to show lmao what anxiety levels and depression levels correlate with the two numerical variables.

2. For the second visualization, we will create an **interactive bar slider** that shows the benefits and drawbacks for having a certain amount of sleep. We would have multiple sections with the scale being hours of sleep. For example, if the user scrolls to 8 hours of sleep, it would show the benefits and drawbacks. This visualization will be using data that has been already collected and processed.

3. For the third visualization, we will have a **chart** that has many options for activities(hours of work, hours of class, other activities) during the day and it would show a recommended amount of sleep for that person. This visualization would be based on user input and put through our own algorithm to determine the amount of sleep the user needs.

## Team Work Commitments
**Tuesdays (3:00PM - 5:00PM) and Thursdays (1:30PM - 3:30PM)**. If we discuss and come to an agreement that we need more time, we can Skype on the weekends and cooperatively work together, or find a time during the weekday (besides our scheduled meetings) to work at Odegaard together.

**Individual goals and roles:**
1. **Jessica Chin - Project Manager** - ensure that we are all communicating and working together. Meeting deadlines with quality work. I want to learn more about how to analyze data and produce information visualizations that could actually be useful in real-life.
2. **Abdirihman Mohamud - Data Analyst** - Provide datasets for our project, ensure that data is properly cited, and help with data visualization and management. I want to learn how to create datasets and interact with our datasets in R.
3. **Samuel Kim - Data Visualization Engineer** - Leading the team on the planning, prototyping and creation of the data models used in this project. Through this role, I want to learn about the importance of showing relevant information in a way that doesn’t confuse the users. I also want to learn how to actually make interactive models compared to static models.

We will do a majority of our communication through Facebook messenger. We will make sure to make the meetings, and if not, we will communicate with our team 12 hours in advance letting each other know whether we can make it.
We will be upfront about our work ethics and production of work. If there is a communication challenge or work breakdown, we will try to convene as a group and come to a mutual agreement on how to problem solve. If worse comes to worse, we will ask a TA or the professor for help and information.
